I am a postgraduate student in University of Edinburgh. I have completed all the courses and the dissertation of Data Science programme, and will graduate in Nov. 2018. Prior to that, I studied in a National Mathematical Training Base at Shandong University, where I built strong mathematical and statistical skills. My current research interest is Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence.

# RESEARCH & PROJECTS

## TensorFlow Applied to Neural Language Models
- Jun. 2018 to Aug. 2018
- **MSc thesis**, supervised by Dr. _Ben Allison_ (Amazon) and Dr. _Tania Bakhos_ (Amazon).
- Contents:
  - Implement Neural Language Models with Mixture of Softmaxes using TensorFlow to solve the Softmax bottleneck.
  - Optimize hyperparameters mainly by specific Random Search; explore the influence of different LSTM implementations and the number of Softmax components.
  - Speed up training by: training models in parallel on multiple GPUs; weight tying; weight matrix factorization; Gradient Clipping.
  - The final model has lower validation and test perplexities as well as higher speed, compared with the original model.
  - Compare the final TensorFlow model with the same model implemented using PyTorch.

## Marketing: Predicting Customer Behaviors
- Mar. 2018 to Apr. 2018
- Coursework in Data Mining and Exploration, with _Yi Wei_, _Wen Jia_ and _Jiayu Li_.
- Contents:
  - Preprocess the large and dirty dataset provided by KDD Cup 2009 competition using pandas, making it clean enough to feed neural networks.
  - Clip variables with large amounts of missing data; fill in the missing data; encode categorical data by one hot; reduce dimensions by linear or unlinear methods including PCA, Isomap & LLE.
  - Predict bahaviors by deep models; optimize hyperparameters; evaluate the result by AUC scores.
  - In terms of customer churn, one of the three behaviors, the prediction AUC exceeds the first place of the competition.

## Instance Segmentation of Nucleus Images
- Feb. 2018 to Apr. 2018
- Coursework in Machine Learning Practical, with _Yi Wei_ and _Zhengjun Yue_, supervised by Prof. _Steve Renals_.
- Contents:
  - Segment nucleus instances from nucleus images acquired in different microscopy systems, which is provided by Kaggle 2018 Data Science Bowl.
  - In the baseline experiments, use fully convolutional networks with VGG16 backbone to semantically segment nuclei from the background, and use open operation to separate individual nuclei.
  - In the contrast experiments, apply Mask RCNN to direct segment nucleus instances. Extract features by ResNet101 with Feature Pymarid Networks; select regions of interest by Region Proposal Networks; semantically segment the nuclei in all regions by fully convolutional networks.
  - Implement the two models and pretrain them on COCO datasets; implement evaluation criteria by mean average procision; carefully tune hyperparameters. Mask RCNN significantly outperforms the baseline model.
